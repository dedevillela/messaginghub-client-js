> An ugly page to send and receive basic messages using the Blip platform

This example demonstrates the use of the `messaginghub-client-js` library to build a simple bot which runs on the [Blip](http://blip.ai) platform.

## How to run
In order to run this example, simply open the `index.html` file on this folder.
You can connect to a MessagingHub server (_Uri_ form field) using your own _Identity_ and _Password_. If you don't have an account, you can create one by accessing the [Omni MessagingHub Portal](http://omni.messaginghub.io/portal).

After connecting to a MessagingHub server, you can send messages, notifications or _pings_ to a bot or person (using the _To_ and _Content_ form fields) connected to the same server.
